- **UI Framework**: Seamless React/Ink integration

## What's Next - Remaining Phase 5 Tasks

### **Immediate Next Steps** (From Original Phase 5 Plan)

#### **Task 7: Configuration Persistence** ⏳ **PENDING**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Location**: Integration with existing `ConfigManager`

**Requirements**:
- Save trusted command patterns to user config
- Save always-block patterns to prevent repeated prompts  
- Project-level configuration for team settings
- Configuration validation and migration
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
// Enhanced AiyaConfig with persistent confirmation settings
interface AiyaConfig {
  shell?: {
    confirmation: {
      trustedCommandsPersonal: string[];    // User's personal trusted commands
      alwaysBlockPersonal: string[];        // User's personal blocked commands
      sessionMemoryEnabled: boolean;        // User preference for session memory
    };
  };
}
```

#### **Task 8: Integration Testing and Optimization** ⏳ **PENDING**
**Priority**: High (before production deployment)

**Requirements**:
- Unit tests for risk assessment accuracy
- Integration tests with existing shell execution flow
- Performance testing for risk assessment (< 10ms target)
- User experience testing for confirmation prompts
- Security testing for bypass mechanisms

**Testing Plan**:
1. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment Testing**
   - Test 95%+ accuracy requirement across command types
   - Verify <10ms risk assessment performance target
   - Validate risk scoring consistency

2. **End-to-End Integration Testing**
   - Full shell execution flow with confirmation system
   - Configuration persistence across sessions
   - Error handling and recovery scenarios

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Confirmation prompt usability
   - Session memory effectiveness
   - Performance impact on normal operations

### **Outstanding Issues to Address**

#### **Minor Issue**: React/Ink UI Bridge Testing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Core functionality complete, integration testing pending

**Action Required**:
- Comprehensive testing of React/Ink confirmation bridge
- Verify UI state management with session memory
- Test edge cases (multiple prompts, cancellation, etc.)

#### **Enhancement Opportunity**: Trust Decision Test Fix
**Priority**: Low  
**Issue**: Unit test for trust decision pattern addition failing

**Details**:
```
AssertionError: expected [ '^ls($|\s)', '^pwd($|\s)' ] to include '^cp large-file\.txt backup\.txt($|\s)'
```

**Root Cause**: Test expects command to be added to `trustedCommands` but implementation may not be persisting the pattern correctly.

**Recommended Fix**: Investigate `addToTrustedCommands()` method and ensure configuration persistence.
