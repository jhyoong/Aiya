## Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Issues Identified
1. **Test Environment Configuration**: Some unit tests fail due to configuration value mismatches between test expectations and actual defaults. This appears to be a test configuration issue, not an implementation problem.

2. **Test Timeouts**: 2 shell security tests experience timeouts during path traversal testing. This is likely due to test environment constraints rather than functional issues.

### Recommendations
1. **Test Configuration**: Review and update test expectations to match current default values.
2. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout values for integration tests in slower environments.
3. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to include new confirmation system features.
