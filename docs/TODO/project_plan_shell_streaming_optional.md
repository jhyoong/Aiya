# Project Plan: Shell MCP Output Streaming (Phase 6, Optional)
**Total Phases**: 4

## Executive Summary
Implement real-time output streaming for the Shell MCP tool to provide live feedback during long-running commands, replacing the current exec()-based approach with spawn()-based streaming that supports cancellation, buffering, and rate limiting.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands with streaming enabled show real-time output during execution
- [ ] Streaming can be cancelled mid-execution without hanging the system
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during long-running streaming commands
- [ ] Performance degradation is <10% compared to non-streaming mode
- [ ] All existing shell functionality continues to work with streaming enabled

---

## PHASE 6.1: Core Streaming Infrastructure
**Objective**: Replace exec() with spawn() to enable basic real-time output streaming

### Deliverables
1. `StreamingShellExecutor` class that uses spawn() instead of exec()
2. Basic stdout/stderr streaming with progress callbacks
3. Streaming mode configuration toggle in ShellToolConfig
4. Integration point with existing ShellMCPClient

### Success Metrics
- [ ] spawn() successfully executes commands with same security as exec()
- [ ] stdout/stderr data streams in real-time (verified manually with `npm run build`)
- [ ] Progress callbacks fire at least every 100ms during active output
- [ ] Streaming mode can be toggled on/off via configuration
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass with streaming disabled

### Tasks
1. Create `StreamingShellExecutor` class in `src/core/mcp/streaming.ts`
2. Implement spawn()-based command execution with security integration
3. Add progress callback interface and implementation
4. Add streaming configuration to ShellToolConfig interface
5. Create integration hooks in ShellMCPClient for streaming mode
6. Add basic error handling for streaming operations

### MANUAL CHECKPOINT
**User must verify the following before proceeding:**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` with streaming enabled - output appears in real-time
- [ ] Run `npm test` with streaming enabled - test output streams live
- [ ] Toggle streaming off - commands execute normally without streaming
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks during 5-minute streaming test
- [ ] All security restrictions still apply (workspace boundaries, dangerous commands)
- [ ] User approval signature: ________________

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of: Phase 5 (User Confirmation System)

---

## PHASE 6.2: Advanced Streaming Features
**Objective**: Add buffering, rate limiting, and cancellation support for robust streaming

### Deliverables
1. `StreamingBuffer` class with configurable buffer size and flush intervals
2. `StreamingRateLimit` class to prevent output flooding
3. Cancellation support using AbortController
4. Enhanced error handling for streaming edge cases
5. Memory management for long-running streams

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Buffer accumulates output and flushes at configurable intervals (default 100ms)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents >1000 lines/second output flooding
- [ ] Cancellation terminates streaming within 500ms of abort signal
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during 30-minute streaming test
- [ ] No zombie processes remain after cancellation

### Tasks
1. Implement `StreamingBuffer` with configurable flush intervals
2. Add `StreamingRateLimit` with configurable max lines/second
3. Integrate AbortController for stream cancellation
4. Add memory monitoring and cleanup for long streams
5. Implement backpressure handling for slow consumers
6. Add comprehensive error recovery for streaming failures

### MANUAL CHECKPOINT
**User must verify the following before proceeding:**
- [ ] Start long-running command, cancel after 10 seconds - process terminates cleanly
- [ ] Run command with high output volume - rate limiting prevents UI freezing
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during 30-minute streaming test - no memory leaks
- [ ] Test network interruption during streaming - graceful error handling
- [ ] Verify buffer settings: 50ms flush shows faster updates, 500ms shows batched
- [ ] User approval signature: ________________

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of: Phase 6.1 (Core Streaming Infrastructure)

**Objective**: Provide comprehensive configuration options and seamless integration with existing shell client

### Deliverables
1. Complete streaming configuration interface in ShellToolConfig
2. Runtime streaming mode switching without restart
3. Integration with existing confirmation system for streaming commands
4. Performance optimization for streaming vs non-streaming modes
5. Streaming-aware logging and audit trails

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All streaming options configurable via ShellToolConfig
- [ ] Streaming mode can be toggled during runtime without restart
- [ ] Confirmation prompts work identically for streaming and non-streaming
- [ ] Performance impact of streaming mode is <10% when not actively streaming
- [ ] All command executions (streaming and non-streaming) are properly logged

### Tasks
1. Extend ShellToolConfig with comprehensive streaming options
2. Add runtime configuration update support for streaming settings
3. Integrate streaming with existing confirmation system
4. Optimize performance for streaming vs non-streaming modes
5. Update logging system to handle streaming output
6. Add streaming-specific audit trail entries

### MANUAL CHECKPOINT
**User must verify the following before proceeding:**
- [ ] Change streaming buffer size via config - takes effect immediately
- [ ] Update rate limit settings - new limits apply to next command
- [ ] Confirmation prompts work for streaming commands (test with risky command)
- [ ] Performance comparison: non-streaming vs streaming mode (measure with `time`)
- [ ] Verify streaming commands appear in logs with proper timestamps
- [ ] User approval signature: ________________

### Dependencies
- Requires completion of: Phase 6.2 (Advanced Streaming Features)

- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended streaming
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable for development workflows
- [ ] All existing shell functionality continues to work

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Memory leaks during long streaming sessions → **Mitigation**: Implement buffer limits and automatic cleanup
2. **Risk**: Streaming mode breaks existing functionality → **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility and comprehensive testing
3. **Risk**: Performance degradation → **Mitigation**: Optimize critical paths and provide streaming toggle
4. **Risk**: Zombie processes after cancellation → **Mitigation**: Robust process cleanup and timeout handling
5. **Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility issues → **Mitigation**: Test on multiple platforms and handle OS-specific differences

## Rollback Plan
1. **Immediate**: Disable streaming mode via configuration toggle
2. **Short-term**: Revert to exec()-based execution for problematic commands
3. **Long-term**: Remove streaming components and restore original exec() implementation
4. **Verification**: Ensure all existing tests pass after rollback

## Configuration Structure
```typescript
interface StreamingConfig {
  enabled: boolean;                    // Enable/disable streaming mode
  bufferSize: number;                  // Buffer size in bytes (default: 8192)
  flushInterval: number;               // Flush interval in ms (default: 100)
  maxLinesPerSecond: number;           // Rate limit (default: 1000)
  maxBufferLines: number;              // Max lines in buffer (default: 1000)
  cancellationTimeout: number;         // Cancellation timeout in ms (default: 5000)
  memoryLimit: number;                 // Max memory usage in MB (default: 100)
  enableProgressCallbacks: boolean;    // Enable progress callbacks (default: true)
}
```

## Success Validation
Each phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding to the next phase. The user must manually verify all checkpoint items and provide signature approval. Final success is measured by:
- All manual checkpoints completed successfully
- Full test suite passing
- Performance benchmarks meeting criteria
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- User acceptance of streaming functionality in development workflows
